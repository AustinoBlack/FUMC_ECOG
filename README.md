# FUMC_ECOG
Easy Creation Of (lower thirds) Graphics

This is a program meant to automate the create of lower thirds graphics for myself and those that follow me at Farmville United Methodist Church.

This program will make heavy use of the python-pptx library. thanks to Steve Canny for creating this library.

# Version 0.25
## Features
The program is currently limited to the command line. If provided a pptx file, the program will take the text contents of the slides and generate slides in the 
lower thirds format I use for work at FUMC. 

## Future Plans
For the next version, version 0.5, I plan on implementing auto-generated transitions into the created powerpoint.
